## About the Collection

This is a collection of family recipes, sorted by category and recipe source. 
The intention of this collection is to be used as a family resource, both for accessing recipe information and for viewing the handwritten notecards. 
The collection includes recipes made by family as well as borrowed recipes from family friends.
